Home Network Security Lab
Overview
This project simulates a secure home network using VirtualBox on Arch Linux with Hyprland. It includes a pfSense firewall managing WAN, LAN (192.168.10.0/24), and DMZ (192.168.2.0/24) networks, a LAN client on Ubuntu (192.168.10.100), and a DMZ web server on Alpine Linux (192.168.2.101) running Nginx. The goal is to practice firewall configuration, traffic monitoring, and network administration skills for a system and network administrator internship.
Setup Steps
1. pfSense VM Setup

Downloaded: netgate-installer-amd64.iso.gz from pfsense.org.
Decompressed: gunzip netgate-installer-amd64.iso.gz.
VM Config: 512MB RAM, 8GB disk, NAT (WAN), Internal LAN (initially 192.168.1.1/24, later changed to 192.168.10.1/24 to avoid Starlink conflict).
Installed pfSense: Set LAN DHCP range to 192.168.10.100â€“200.
Resolved KVM Conflict: Unloaded kvm_intel to allow VirtualBox to run (April 16, 2025).
Web UI: Accessible at https://192.168.10.1 (admin/pfsense).

2. LAN Client Setup

Created VM: LAN-Client (Ubuntu, 2GB RAM, 10GB disk).
Network: Internal Network LAN, assigned IP 192.168.10.100/24 via DHCP.
Tested Access: Confirmed connectivity to pfSense (ping 192.168.10.1) and web UI.

3. DMZ Web Server Setup

Created VM: DMZ-Web-Alpine (Alpine Linux, 512MB RAM, 2GB disk).
Network: Internal Network DMZ, assigned IP 192.168.2.101/24 via DHCP.
Installed Nginx: Document root at /var/www/localhost/htdocs.
Test Page: Added index.html with <h1>Welcome to DMZ Web Server</h1>.
Timezone Fix: Set to Africa/Antananarivo (Madagascar, UTC+3) using tzdata (April 16, 2025).
Tested Access: From LAN client via curl http://192.168.2.101.

4. Firewall Configuration

LAN Rules:
Allow LAN to DMZ web server (192.168.2.101:80).
Allow LAN to internet.
Block LAN to RFC1918 networks (using alias RFC1918_Networks).


DMZ Rules:
Allow DMZ to internet.
Block DMZ to LAN.
Block DMZ to RFC1918 networks.


Fixes: Reordered rules and adjusted RFC1918 alias to exclude lab subnets (April 17, 2025).

5. Traffic Monitoring

Enabled Logging: On firewall rules for passed and blocked traffic.
Monitored Logs: Via Status > System Logs > Firewall.
Packet Capture: Used Diagnostics > Packet Capture to analyze LAN traffic.

Challenges and Solutions

Starlink IP Conflict: Changed pfSense LAN from 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.10.1 to avoid conflict with Starlink router (April 16, 2025).
VirtualBox KVM Error: Unloaded kvm_intel to allow pfSense VM to run (April 16, 2025).
DMZ Connectivity: Added NAT for DMZ internet access and adjusted firewall rules (April 16, 2025).
Nginx 404 Error: Fixed document root to /var/www/localhost/htdocs on Alpine (April 16, 2025).
RFC1918 Blocking Issue: Reordered rules and excluded lab subnets from alias (April 17, 2025).

Future Improvements

Add IDS/IPS (e.g., Suricata) for advanced threat detection.
Simulate attacks (e.g., brute force) to test firewall rules.
Expand to include VLANs, as practiced in Packet Tracer (April 10, 2025).
